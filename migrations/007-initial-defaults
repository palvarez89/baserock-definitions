# Baserock definitions defaults
# =============================

# The DEFAULTS file is treated specially by Baserock build tools.

# Predefined build commands
# -------------------------
#
# Common patterns in build instructions can be defined here, which can save
# users from having to write lots of similar-looking chunk .morph files.
#
# There are pre- and post- variants for each set of commands. These exist so
# you can add more commands without having to copy the defaults. For example,
# to create an extra symlink after running `make install`, you can use
# post-install-commands. Since these exist as a way of extending the defaults,
# you cannot set default values for the pre- and post- commands.
#
# The set of environment variables available when these commands are executed
# is not formally specified right now, but you can assume PREFIX, DESTDIR and
# MORPH_ARCH are all set.

# Predefined artifact splitting rules
# -----------------------------------
#
# Once a build has completed, you have some files that have been installed into
# $DESTDIR. The splitting rules control how many 'artifact' tarballs are
# generated as a result of the build, and which files from $DESTDIR end up in
# which 'artifact'.
#
# The default split rules are defined here. These can be overriden in
# individual chunk .morph files and stratum .morph files using the 'products'
# field.
